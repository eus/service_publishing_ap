The idea is to have an isolated (not connected to any other network) wireless Access Point that provides services available in the Access Point itself. This is possible by using wireless Access Point powered by OpenWRT. An isolated service can be useful for use in a shopping center where people can get direction by accessing the Access Point through their gadgets. For other possible use cases, read "doc/Use Cases.txt".
