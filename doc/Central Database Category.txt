DB Distribution Format
Standard SQL DDL and DML text will be used to achieve the highest interoperability.

DB Schema

category
Field Name 	Field Type
cat_id		integer
cat_name 	varchar(128)
is_binary_data 	integer

DDL
create table category (cat_id integer not null primary key, cat_name varchar(128) not null, is_binary_data char(1) not null default 'n');
Note

    * cat_id will start from 1. New category ID will be added sequentially so that there is no gap in the cat_id. Category ID is immutable once it is inserted. It cannot be deleted. Therefore, the administrator of this central database has to be really careful in introducing a new category since upon insertion (distribution is then implied), no revocation is possible.
    * cat_name is the name that will be displayed to the user. Therefore, cat_name has to be short and descriptive in describing a category.

category_structure
Field Name 	Field Type
cat_id 		integer
subcat_id 	integer

DDL
create table category_structure (cat_id integer not null, subcat_id integer not null, foreign key (cat_id) references category (cat_id), foreign key (subcat_id) references category (cat_id));
Note

    * cat_id serves as a parent category of subcat_id.
    * Insertion of a new entry is immutable. It cannot be deleted. Therefore, the administrator of this central database has to be really careful in introducing a new category since upon insertion (distribution is then implied), no revocation is possible.
    * An application should parse the category_structure data once as a 2D link list and store the resulting internal representation for quick category display to the user.

version
Field Name 	Field Type
ending_cat_id 	integer
version 	integer

DDL
create table version (ending_cat_id integer not null, version integer not null, foreign key (ending_cat_id) references category (cat_id));
Note

    * This allow a person to easily upgrade his/her DB from a certain version to the latest version by only downloading the relevant records.
    * A new entry is immutable. It cannot be deleted.
    * A new entry creates an additional link named "Download upgrade data from version [CREATED_VERSION - 1]" in the public interface to download the database.
